My Concierge is an elegant virtual travel assistant. It provides a simplistic, minimalist approach to searching for hotels and flights.

### What's to come

Besides the flight and hotel search functionality, we will also be adding:

1.  [ ] Validation for form inputs
2.  [ ] Back and forward navigation for form
3.  [ ] User accounts for saving searches

Will add other options as they come to mind.
